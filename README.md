# dqn_caffe

Just for fun :)

We are now trying to figure out how to adapt caffe to reinforcement learning, with experience replay and RMSProp as proposed in the [paper](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf). Simplified classical problem, the n-bandit, in reinforcement learning was used to test the current modified solver.

Of course we may just learn how [muupan](https://github.com/muupan/dqn-in-the-caffe) implemented it, but we are going to implement our own one as exercise, and for fun.
